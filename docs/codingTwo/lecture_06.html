    👋🏻 Hi 🪱's!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Third, what subjects would you like me to start covering in future Tuesday lectures? Augmented Reality? Making Games with SpriteKit? Something else? Please DM me in Slack with your requests! If I don't hear anything, I'm going to continue with UIKit things, so it's in your interest to ask for something more interesting! 🙇🏻</div>
  <div>Fourth, I had tutorials with half of you yesterday - just a reminder to the other half of you that I'm expecting to see presentations from you this Friday on the progress that you've made on your playful apps for Toad bakery. There won't be anyone external there, just us, so it doesn't have to be too polished, just be honest about what progress you've made and demo demo demo! 🐸</div>
  <div>
    Next, let's move onto "Guided Project: Restaurant" - let's review the steps of the app and try it out on our machines. You wouldn't develop an app like this like this today (you'd used SwiftUI for starters).
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, let's move onto 3.1 "Collection Views". Let's start with the Keynote, review the textbook before moving onto the review questions as a group. Complete the "Lab-Emoji Dictionary" as homework.
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, let's move onto 3.2 "Swift Generics". Let's start with the Keynote, review the textbook before moving onto the review questions as a group. Complete the "Lab-Life-Form Search" as homework.
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, let's move onto 3.3 "Dynamic Data". Let's start with the Keynote, review the textbook before moving onto the review questions as a group. Complete the "Lab-iTunes Search (Part 4)" as homework.
