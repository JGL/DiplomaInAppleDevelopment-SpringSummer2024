  <div>Hi! 👻</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>How are things going with your apps? I want to see definite proposals at the next meeting with the client on Friday 15th March - that's only three weeks away! Remember - be ambitious with your idea, but them skateboard, skateboard, skateboard. Develop the mockup in SwiftUI, with a series of screens. I can go through this with you in our 1-1 tutorials on Monday mornings.</div>
