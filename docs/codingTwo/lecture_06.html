    👋🏻 Hi 🪱's!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Third, what subjects would you like me to start covering in future Tuesday lectures? Augmented Reality? Making Games with SpriteKit? Something else? Please DM me in Slack with your requests! 🙇🏻</div>
  <div>
    Next, let's move onto "Guided Project: Restaurant" - let's review the steps of the app and try it out on our machines. You wouldn't develop an app like this like this today (you'd used SwiftUI for starters).
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, let's move onto 3.1 "Collection Views". Let's start with the Keynote, review the textbook before moving onto the review questions as a group. Complete the "Lab-Emoji Dictionary" as homework.
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, let's move onto 3.2 "Swift Generics". Let's start with the Keynote, review the textbook before moving onto the review questions as a group. Complete the "Lab-Life-Form Search" as homework.
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, let's move onto 3.3 "Dynamic Data". Let's start with the Keynote, review the textbook before moving onto the review questions as a group. Complete the "Lab-iTunes Search (Part 4)" as homework.
