    👋🏻 Hi! Welcome to Block Two! Well done on all successfully completing Block One! 🎉
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    Let's start by reviewing the README.md for Block Two on the Block Two GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024">https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024</a>. Don't forget to make note of the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024#block-2-assessment">assessment schedule</a> in your own calendars. As you know from Block One, assessment will be upon you before you know it! Tutorials will continue as normal on Monday mornings.

    Let's continue by looking at the wiki for Block Two on the Block Two GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024/wiki">https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024/wiki</a>, paying particular attention to the reading list wiki page: <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024/wiki/Reading-List"></a>
