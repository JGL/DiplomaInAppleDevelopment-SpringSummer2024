  <div>Hi! 👻</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, please submit your Keynote presentations to the <a href="https://moodle.arts.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=79519">Product Two Moodle</a> right now (link might only be open at 1000? If so, set a reminder Joel).</div>
  <div>Third, who wants to go first - I'll video your presentations if that's ok?</div>
  <div>Fourth, don't forget you'll need to make a 30 second 1080p video for the end of year show video too - Eddie and Iara, would you like to say a few words? Have you spoken to Pete Mackenzie?</div>
  <div>Fifth, thanks so much for being such a brilliant group of people. Let's get a group photo? 🙇🏻
  </div>
  <div>Sixth - don't forget my support of you doesn't end today, or when your degree finishes - you can email me via joelgethinlewis.com any time. Please Slack me the source code for your projects and the Keynotes, for my records. 🪱🖖🏻
