  <div>Hi! 👻</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Third, I'm away next week in Australia 🦘🐨🇦🇺! No tutorials or lectures from me! ML Two will still be happening as normal.</div>
  <div>Fourth, let's go around the room and hear from everyone on their progress on their playful apps for Toad bakery 🐸. Don't forget you'll need to make a 30 second 1080p video for the end of year show video too - Eddie and Iara, would you like to say a few words? Have you spoken to Pete Mackenzie?</div>
  <div>Next, let's try some of the official Apple SwiftUI tutorial series...</div>
  <div>Let's continue the latest, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/create-update-and-delete-data">"Develop in Swift: Create, update, and delete data"</a>.</div>
  <div>Let's try <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui-concepts">"Learning SwiftUI"</a>.</div>
  <div>Let's try <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui">"Introducing SwiftUI"</a>.</div>
  <div>Finally, let's review lots of the playground Apps we created, but making them in Xcode this time: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/sample-apps">"Exploring SwiftUI Sample Apps"</a>.</div>
  <div>
    Thanks!<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
