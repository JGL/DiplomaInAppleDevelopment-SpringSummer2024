    👋🏻 Hi 🪱's!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Third, we'll be starting AR lectures next week!</div>
  <div>Fourth, this Friday we'll be doing a check in between everyone on their apps and presentations, and then we'll move onto more SwiftUI learning. 🐸</div>
  <div>
    Next, let's move onto 3.4 "Compositional Layout". Let's start with the Keynote, review the textbook before moving onto the review questions as a group. Review the "Lab-Emoji Dictionary (part 3)" as homework.
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, let's move onto 3.5 "Advanced Compositional Layout". Let's start with the Keynote, review the textbook before moving onto the review questions as a group. Review "Itunes Search (part 5)" as homework.
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, let's move onto 3.6 "Local Notifications". Let's start with the Keynote, review the textbook before moving onto the review questions as a group. Review "Alarm" as homework. Review "Lab Billmanager" as homework.
  </div>
  <div>
    Finally, let's review the "Guided Project: Habits" chapter. You wouldn't develop an app like this like this today (you'd used SwiftUI for starters). See you next Tuesday for some Augmented Reality learning!
